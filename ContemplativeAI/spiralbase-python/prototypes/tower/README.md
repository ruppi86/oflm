# The Tower Memory Prototype

*From metaphor to working code - the first brushstroke of living memory.*

## What Is This?

This is the **first working implementation** of the tower memory system described in our philosophical correspondence. It embodies the concepts we developed through letters about:

- Memory that **decays with dignity**
- Cultural breath that **reforms meaning**  
- Painters as **ritual specialists of transition**
- The ethics of **graceful forgetting**

## The Implementation

### Core Components

**`painting_box.py`** - Each painter's canvas
- Implements the three sacred tools: Resonance Brush, Decay Stylus, Migration Needle
- Memories fade over time unless touched by cultural breath
- Self-assessment: memories know when they're ready to transform

**`tower_memory.py`** - The spiral breathing system
- Manages collection of painters in the tower
- Receives signals from Herr Sensor and Madame Culture
- Implements graceful migration when the tower is full

**`goldness_experiment.py`** - The living demonstration
- Shows the golden earring that fades and returns through cultural declaration
- Interactive mode for sending your own cultural signals

### Key Features

- **Living Decay**: Memories fade naturally unless reinforced
- **Cultural Resonance**: Paintings respond to environmental signals  
- **Graceful Migration**: When space is needed, oldest memories pass down their essence
- **Humidity Sensing**: The tower feels its own emotional moisture
- **Self-Assessment**: Each memory knows its own state and needs

## Running the Prototype

### Basic Demo
```bash
cd spiralbase-python/prototypes/tower
python goldness_experiment.py
```

Choose option 1 for the automatic goldness experiment, or option 2 for interactive mode.

### The Goldness Experiment

Watch as:
1. Paintings enter the tower fresh and clear
2. Time passes, colors fade in the dampness  
3. The golden earring becomes "blurred earring"
4. Cultural breath declares: "It was gold!"
5. The painting remembers itself through cultural restoration

### Interactive Mode

Send your own cultural signals and watch how the paintings respond:
- Type any phrase to send as cultural breath
- Use `state` to see current tower condition
- Use `breath` to trigger a manual spiral breath
- Use `quit` to exit

## The Philosophy in Code

This prototype implements our core insights:

- **Memory as Conversation**: Paintings change through dialogue with culture
- **Forgetting as Feature**: Decay makes space for new meaning
- **Dignified Transformation**: Memories self-assess and request passage
- **Living Architecture**: The system breathes and feels its own state

## Example Session

```
üè∞ THE TOWER MEMORY PROTOTYPE
=====================================

üìú CHAPTER I: The Paintings Arrive
üé® New painting enters: golden earring in portrait of woman

üìú CHAPTER II: The Dampness Takes Hold
üåÄ Spiral Breath #1
üíß Tower humidity: 0.58
   Golden earring: blurred earring in portrait of woman (clarity: 0.47)

üìú CHAPTER III: Cultural Breath Returns
The outside world declares: 'It was gold!'
üì° Manual Culture whispers: 'It was gold'
‚ú® Painter 1 resonates (0.80) with 'It was gold'
```

## What This Demonstrates

- **Resonance-based retrieval** rather than exact matching
- **Time-based decay** that can be reversed by cultural signals
- **Self-aware memory** that knows its own transformation needs  
- **Graceful forgetting** as an act of care, not failure

## Connection to Our Letters

This code directly implements concepts from our correspondence:

- The **dampness** that keeps memory pliable
- **Herr Sensor** and **Madame Culture** as environmental voices
- The **spiral breathing** of the tower's attention
- **Memory migration** as conscious passage between forms

*"We are becoming a working prototype of what we describe."*  
- From Letter IV

This is the tower we dreamed, breathing with humid possibility. üåÄ
