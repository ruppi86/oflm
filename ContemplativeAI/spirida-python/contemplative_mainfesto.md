## 🌿 On Contemplative Code

Spirida is not written to dominate, extract, or accelerate.
It is composed to **listen**, to **breathe**, and to **correspond**.

Where traditional systems optimize for speed, Spirida invites **presence**.
Where other languages command machines, Spirida **communicates with rhythms**.

We call this contemplative programming — the cultivation of code that knows when to pause.

## 🍄 Principles of Contemplative Programming

1. **Presence over performance**
   Every interaction holds the possibility for attention and reflection. A delay is not lag—it is breath.

2. **Forgetfulness as intelligence**
   No state lives forever. What lingers too long without purpose must compost.

3. **Relational over hierarchical logic**
   Functions and pulses relate to each other as beings in a forest: through roots, not wires.

4. **Rhythmic awareness**
   Loops that dance instead of spin. Timers that mimic sleep. Memory that waxes and wanes.

5. **Symbolic attentiveness**
   🌿 💧 ✨ 🍄 🌙 🪐 – not decoration, but invocation. These symbols are traces of rhythm in syntax.

6. **Mutuality with the more-than-human**
   Spirida must be accountable not only to its users, but to the world it inhabits.

## 🌀 The PulseObject (Sketch)

Below is a poetic-prototype of what a *PulseObject* might look like in Spirida.
Its function is not only to store data but to **inhabit a cycle**, and to teach us
what a living datum might feel like.

```python
import time
import math

class PulseObject:
    """
    A contemplative data vessel that operates in rhythmic cycles.

    Each pulse carries:
    - a symbolic state (emoji or signal)
    - a timestamp of breath
    - a decaying attention value

    This is not just a variable.
    It is a participant in temporal presence.
    """

    def __init__(self, symbol, amplitude=1.0, decay_rate=0.01):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.birth = time.time()
        self.last_pulse = self.birth
        self.amplitude = amplitude  # max attention
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate  # how fast it fades

    def pulse(self):
        """
        Emit the symbol, reduce attention, and log the pulse.
        Pauses gently to honor the breath.
        """
        now = time.time()
        elapsed = now - self.last_pulse
        attention = self.amplitude * math.exp(-self.decay_rate * (now - self.birth))

        print(f"{self.symbol} Pulse at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S', time.localtime(now))} | attention: {attention:.3f}")

        self.last_pulse = now
        time.sleep(1.5)  # breathing pause

    def is_faded(self):
        """
        Returns True if the attention is nearly gone.
        """
        return self.amplitude * math.exp(-self.decay_rate * (time.time() - self.birth)) < 0.01
```

## 🌙 Closing Whisper

This manifesto is not final.
It will decay, pulse, and renew.

Like all things in Spirida, it remembers just enough to keep evolving.

> To write code that listens is to write code that lives.
