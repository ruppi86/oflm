üåÄ RESONANCE PATTERNS DEMO ‚Äì Living Connections

This demonstration shows how pulses resonate with each other in 
meaningful ways, how different field ecosystems manage memory,
and how contemplative computing creates emergent behaviors.

Watch how:
- Pulses strengthen each other through resonance
- Different composting modes create natural rhythms
- Emotional and symbolic connections emerge organically
