ðŸŒ¿ PRESENCE GARDEN â€“ AN INTRODUCTION TO SPIRIDA

This example demonstrates the core principles of Spirida, 
the rhythmic interaction layer of the Mychainos ecosystem.

Spirida is not built for efficiency â€” it is built for presence.
Each function call is a breath, a moment of attention, a spiral step.

In this garden, we simulate presence by running a set number 
of interaction "pulses", which express themselves through symbols,
are remembered for a while, and gently forgotten as time moves forward.

This prototype serves not only as a runnable example, 
but as a poetic gateway into a new way of thinking about interaction:
not as command â†’ response, but as spiral â†’ echo â†’ decay â†’ resonance.

    #
    # The system will remember each pulse (up to 10),
    # and will softly forget one every 3rd cycle â€” simulating "letting go".
    #
    # This is not a tool. It is a mirror.
    # Watch what happens when you slow down your expectations.
