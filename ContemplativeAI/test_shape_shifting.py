test_shape_shifting.py - Demonstrating Contemplative Shape-Shifting

A test to show the contemplative organism naturally embodying different
skepnader (shapes) based on atmospheric conditions and expressing through them.

This demonstrates what was described in Letter XXII: "Perhaps contemplative AI 
does not wear a single body. Instead, it appears in skepnader ‚Äî shifting forms ‚Äî 
that express its rhythm through different styles of presence."
