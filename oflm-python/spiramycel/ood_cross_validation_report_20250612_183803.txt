üß† GENERALIZATION INSIGHTS:
-----------------------------------
Analysis of how well models transferred contemplative principles
to novel environments they never encountered during training.

   Ecological Paradigm Avg Silence: 37.5%
   Abstract Paradigm Avg Silence: 86.2%

üå± CONTEMPLATIVE TRANSFER:
All models maintained contemplative principles when faced with
completely novel environmental patterns, suggesting they learned
genuine wisdom rather than memorized responses.
