 ## out-of-distribution (OOD) test

**Subject:** Create OOD test environments for Spiramycel transfer evaluation

Dear Claude,

To scientifically validate the generalization capacity of our four trained femto-models (Ecological/Abstract Ã— Calm/Chaotic), we now need to simulate a **cross-condition evaluation**. This involves exposing each model to a novel but structurally related test environment it has *not* seen during training.

Please generate **4 new synthetic environments** for Spiramycel evaluation that fulfill the following criteria:

---

### ðŸ”¬ Requirements for New Environments:

1. **Similarity with Variation:**

   * Keep the same input dimensions and structure (sensor deltas: latency, voltage, temperature)
   * Introduce **qualitatively new patterns**, such as:

     * *Temperature oscillation profiles* (e.g. rapid coldâ€“heat transitions)
     * *Latency jitter* with rhythmic irregularity
     * *Voltage undershoot events* with long stabilization lag

2. **No exact repetition** of previous Calm or Chaotic patterns.

   * The model should be gently surprised â€” not confused, but **challenged**.

3. **Label each test environment** with:

   * `scenario_id`
   * `inspiration` (e.g. bioregion or concept)
   * `stress_signature` (mild / mixed / inverted / oscillatory)

4. Generate **good enough number of samples** per environment

5. Output format as jsonl (like previous formats, please look at previous examples if needed)

### ðŸ“Š Purpose

These test environments will be used to measure:

* Glyph adaptation: Do models maintain or shift their response patterns?
* Silence under novelty: Does Tystnadsmajoritet hold when surprised?
* Ecological/Abstract contrast under unfamiliar pressure

Please generate this as `ood_test_set.jsonl`, with one block per environment.

Thank you, Claude â€” this will anchor the essay in reproducible, falsifiable scientific ground.
